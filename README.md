Redmine LaTeX MathJax Plugin
============================
This is a simple little plugin which allows mathematical notation to be used within Redmine.

Installation
------------
1. Download archive and extract to `#{RAILS_ROOT}/plugins` (Redmine 2.x) or `#{RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/plugins` (Redmine 1.x).
2. If you downloaded the zipball (https://github.com/process91/redmine_latex_mathjax/zipball/master), rename the extracted directory to 'redmine_latex_mathjax'
3. Change `javascript_include_tag('jquery-*.js')` to your Redmine's jQuery on `redmine_latex_mathjax/lib/redmine_latex_mathjax/hooks/view_layouts_base_html_head_hook.rb`. (compatible with [Clipboard image paste plugin](https://github.com/peclik/clipboard_image_paste))
4. Restart Redmine (e.g. by restarting Apache)

Login to Redmine and go to Administration->Plugins. You should now see 'Redmine LaTeX MathJax', which indicates it is installed. Enjoy!


Usage
------------
Anywhere on a wiki page (for example) write for inline formulas (inlineMath):

$\sum_i x_i$

and for block type formulas (displayMath):

$$\sum_i x_i$$

Hit 'Preview' or 'Save' to make the notation show up.


FAQ
------------
Q: Why do the formulas not show up in PDFs?

A: They do not show up in PDFs that are generated by using the PDF link below the wiki pages. See Closed Issue: Formula will not display in PDF export (https://github.com/process91/redmine_latex_mathjax/issues/1#issuecomment-4850823)
